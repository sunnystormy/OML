Copyright (c) 2017 Michael J. Brodeur <michael.brodeur@unseen.is>


PREAMBLE:

This Open Material License (the "License") applies to any original material specimen
(the "Original Material"), living or nonliving, organic or inorganic,
whose owner (the "Licensor") has applied the following licensing notice before engaging in
any formal/non-formal exchange of the Original Material between the Licensor and the recipient (the "Licensee").

Licensed under the Open Material License version 0.1


LICENSE:

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:

a) to reproduce the Original Material in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;

b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Material, thereby creating derivative materials ("Derivative Materials") based upon the Original Material;

c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Material and Derivative Materials to the public, under any license of your choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in this Open Material License;


2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Material and Derivative Materials.


3) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Material, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Material without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Material. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Material that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.


4) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in text form of any Derivative Materials that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Original Material, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the publication of any Derivative Materials that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Material.


5) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Material including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.


6) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Material or a Derivative Material, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Materials based upon the Original Material, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).


7) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.


8) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Material outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.


9) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.


10) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.


11) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.


12) Right to Use. You may use the Original Material in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
